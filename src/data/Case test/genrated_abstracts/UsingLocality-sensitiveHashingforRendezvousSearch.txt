Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a technique to generate a set of locally labeled bits by using an approximation of the global set of bits in the range of [0] + 1. It was originally suggested to generate the sets of bits that are locally labeled in a LSH distributed hash table (DHT) when no one is using them. LSH enables efficient search and rendezvous algorithms in general multi-user settings where all users can be identified, each of them has multiple labels, and the global set of bits is known. Basically, locality-sensitive hashing is the combination of LSH and the concept of label propagation in the hash table. Whenever a new user joins, the global set of bits associated with the new user are propagated from the labeled user to the new user via the local labeled bits of the new user, while the global labeled bits of the old user are propagated to the new user via the label propagation of the old user. In LSH, there are several mechanisms that enable global channel labels to be propagated to the local channels. First, the channels in the multi-user network are numbered by the local labeling of the users, and each user is allowed to select any one of the channels. Second, when two users are on different channels, the unused channels can be
