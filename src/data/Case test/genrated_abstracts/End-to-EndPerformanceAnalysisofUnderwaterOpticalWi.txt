Light-scattering surfaces of large reflectors. In this context, the impact of scattering and absorption on UOWC systems is considered as one of the main obstacles limiting their application to short-range applications such as communication between the seafloor and the surface. In this paper, we analyze the performance of two relaying and routing techniques for UOWC networks, namely, “Selective Forwarding and Repeater (SFR)” and “Selective Relaying with Multiple Access Points (SRP)”, to analyze the performance of these techniques when the location of one of the stations is uncertain.
