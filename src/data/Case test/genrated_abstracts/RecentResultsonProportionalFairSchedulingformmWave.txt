delay at the network level, and it can be reduced through efficient scheduling techniques such as proportional fair scheduling. PFS schemes have been developed to manage the high packet latency and large number of data packets that require transmission. Nevertheless, the scheduling of PFS is very complicated due to mmWave radio hopping process, which means that the optimal performance of PFS cannot be reached until the PFS network design is developed. This paper presents the development of PFS schemes for mmWave networks.
