Information may be accessed from a distance thanks to computer networks. Wireless or wired networks are also possible. Due to recent developments in wireless infrastructure, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) were developed. Activities or events occurring in the environment are monitored, recorded, and managed by WSN. Through a variety of routing techniques, data relaying is done in these systems. The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, is defined as the integration of complex physical automation systems made up of machinery and devices connected by sensors and managed by software. This is done to boost the efficiency and reliability of operations. Industry 4.0 is viewed as a possibility because of industrial IoT, the concept of leveraging IoT technology in manufacturing. delivering, in an industrial setting, a means of connecting engines, power grids, and sensors to the cloud. In this essay, we'll try to comprehend how the Internet of Things (IoT) works in wireless sensor networks and how it might be used in various situations.
