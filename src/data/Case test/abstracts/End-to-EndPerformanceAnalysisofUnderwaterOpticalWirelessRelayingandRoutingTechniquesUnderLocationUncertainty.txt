On the contrary of low speed and high delay acoustic systems, underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) can deliver a high speed and low latency service at the expense of short communication ranges. Therefore, multihop communication is of utmost importance to improve degree of connectivity and overall performance of underwater optical wireless networks (UOWNs). In this regard, this paper investigates relaying and routing techniques and provides their end-to-end (E2E) performance analysis under the location uncertainty. To achieve robust and reliable links, we first consider adaptive beamwidths and derive the divergence angles under the absence and presence of a pointing-acquisitioning-and-tracking (PAT) mechanism. Thereafter, important E2E performance metrics (e.g., data rate, bit error rate, transmission power, amplifier gain, etc.) are obtained for two potential relaying techniques; decode & forward (DF) and optical amplify & forward (AF). We develop centralized routing schemes for both relaying techniques to optimize E2E rate, bit error rate, and power consumption. Alternatively, a distributed routing protocol, namely Light Path Routing (LiPaR), is proposed by leveraging the range-beamwidth tradeoff of UOWCs. LiPaR is especially shown to be favorable when there is no PAT mechanism and available network information. In order to show the benefits of multihop communications, extensive simulations are conducted to compare different routing and relaying schemes under different network parameters and underwater environments.
