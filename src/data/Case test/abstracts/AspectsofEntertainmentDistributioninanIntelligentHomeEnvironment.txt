The paper presents an implementation and tests of a simple home entertainment distribution architecture (server + multiple clients) implemented using two conventional cabling architectures: CATV coaxial cable and conventional Ethernet. This architecture is created taking into account the "Home gateway" concept present in most attempts to solve the problem of the "Intelligent home". A short presentation of the experimental is given with an investigation of the main performances obtained using this architecture. The experiments revealed that this simple solution makes possible to have entertainment and data services with performances close to traditional data services in a cost-effective architecture
